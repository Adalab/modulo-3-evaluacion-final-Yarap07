Thanks to the filters above Rick and Morty Land allows you to look for your favorite characters following this criteria:

- **Name**: no matter if you write it in lowercase or uppercase your search will always be a success. However, if you look for a non existing character, you will get an error message back to warn you.

- **Species**: choosing between the two existing species: humans or aliens.

- **Status**: select the status of your characters among all the options on the list.

- **Origin**: check as many origins as you want to find all the characters you wish.

If you change your mind and you want to use no filter, just by clicking on the reset button attached below you will be able to reset all the filter values to their starting point.

Furthermore, if you wish to keep your search for the future, do not worry. The page is developed to store all filters information in your Local Storage so you can go back to your former search whenever you want.
